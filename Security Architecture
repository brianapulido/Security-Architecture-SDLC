Simply put, security architecture is the strategic design and implementation of information security systems. 
Security architecture involves the use of security technologies, policies and processes to protect an organization's IT infrastructure from unauthorized access, misuse, modification or destruction.
The goal of secure architecture design is to reduce risk to an organization's IT assets and operations.
Security architecture provides a roadmap or framework for building a resilient IT environment that aligns with an organization's unique business goals, compliance requirements and risk management profile.
A layered defense approach to security recognizes that internet security risks can occur at different levels and implementing security controls across multiple layers increases protection.

IT infrastructure is multilayered and therefore a multilayered approach to protection is optimal.

There are four system layers to consider:
  System level--> most basic level but also last line of defense. At this level the goal is to have proper system security configuration.
  Network level-->
  Application level-->
  Transmision level-->
